Explanation:

    Flatpickr Inclusion: Includes the Flatpickr CSS and JavaScript files via CDN.
    Initialize Flatpickr: Initializes Flatpickr on the input field with the following options:
    minDate: Sets the minimum selectable date to June 1, 2024 ('2024-06-01').
    disable: Specifies an array of dates to be disabled, such as holidays (Christmas, New Year, and Independence Day).

Customizing the Minimum Date and Disabled Dates:

    Minimum Date: Modify the value of minDate to the desired minimum date.
    Disabled Dates: Add or remove dates in the disable array to reflect the dates you want to disable.

This approach ensures that users cannot select dates before the specified minimum date and also cannot select the specific dates listed in the disable array. Flatpickr provides a user-friendly interface and makes it easy to handle these customizations.
